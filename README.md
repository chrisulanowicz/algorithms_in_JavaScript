This is a collection of algorithms completed in JavaScript.

Most files can be run independently except where noted (also, files requiring others will have a require line near the top).

To run independent files using Node.js via command line
	- Navigate to the directly containing the file
	- Run `node ${filename}`

Independent files can also be run in a browser console by copying and pasting all of the code within the file into the browser console.

For files that require others, the individual file can still be run using node just as above as long as you're working within the entire project structure.

Algorithms are written using plain ES5 JavaScript.  Cases using ES6 will be noted.

Testing is slowly being brought in using Mocha.  This is still in progress and more info will be forthcoming.
